This Privacy Policy outlines how we (the Komikeros Project team) collect and use your data while you are on this website.

### Data collected
We do not want to collect your personal data. However, in this age of [surveillance capitalism](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/), internet services make doing so difficult to avoid.

1. This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which may log your IP address and other information for security purposes.
  - We do not (and cannot) access this data.
  - GitHub is [GDPR-compliant](https://github.blog/2018-04-19-updates-to-our-privacy-statement-and-terms-of-service/). For more details, see their [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages).

### How we use your data

__To perform simple analytics__

We use GoatCounter's web analytics tool to understand our audience, e.g., how are people discovering this website? Where are they from?

We do not wish to track you, or even collect data that allows us to track you. Thus the choice of GoatCounter: unlike other web analytics tools, GoatCounter does not download cookies or other files to your devices, and gives us access only to aggregated metrics. Indeed, this website uses no cookies or trackers or any sort.

We invite you to view our [GoatCounter metrics dashboard](https://komikeros.goatcounter.com) and see for yourself what data we collect.

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice. Changes to this Privacy Policy take effect immediately upon their posting on this page.
